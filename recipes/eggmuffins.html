        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>These breakfast egg muffins are inspired by your favorite morning casserole or omelet! Great for an on-the-go breakfast and very customizable to your tastes. You can substitute any vegetables or meat that you like. I love to make a dozen of these and have them in my fridge to grab in the morning on my way to work.</p1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>8 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 ¾ ounces fully-cooked bacon pieces (such as Oscar Mayer®)</li>
            <li>¼ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ (8 ounce) package shredded mild Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Place bell peppers and green onions into a large bowl. Add eggs, bacon, milk, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese into the bowl and whisk until incorporated. Pour mixture equally into the prepared muffin cups.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.</li>
